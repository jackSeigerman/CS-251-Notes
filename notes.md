COMP 251 NOTES

OS doesnt run anything until woken up
to wake the kernal, interupt with: 

        ret = write (fd, buff, size);

user mode vs kernal mode

multiprogramming 
 a process is an os abstraction of a running program
 many os's support many programs running concurently

 to start a process:
 1. load instructions into ram, create and initialize new process, initialize cou state to run process

 kernal gets launched from bios, or booting

 kernal is core os fucntionalty for interfacing the hardware and I/O

tmux creates a new window with a consistent connection

you need another program or an interpertor to run code from python or java

c interpetor is 

        clang -o 

programming contraints

1. comments 
2. variables - initialization, delceration
3. I/O functions
4. statements (how they are indicated)
5. conditioanls - truth values
6. functions - call, define
7. loops
8. acess

/# include in c allows for pre compilation like import in PY

        #include <>

all variables and methods need to have a type

if method has no inputs then you put void in that spot

        int main(void)

" is string literals and ' is used for chars
